# Seedling Height Sorter
Hello fellow gardeners!  The idea for this project came about because I always run into the same problem every year: I have a tray of small seedlings that need to be planted, and no idea how to plant them. Every gardener knows that tall plants should go towards the back, and short towards the front, but accomplishing this is no easy feat. Thatâ€™s why I created the Seedling Height Sorter App. It sorts your seedlings for you, and then also provides you with an easy to print out list. Use it to make your gardening a little less stressful. 

Technologies used:  JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

### Features I am currently in the process of adding:

- Editing of individual plants
- Replacement of the deletion confirmation popup with yes/no buttons in the UI
- The plant list being stored as a cookie
- All conversions being located in one file
- ~~Plant suggestions automatically populating the height input fields~~  Done.
- ~~Redesign the UI~~  Done.
