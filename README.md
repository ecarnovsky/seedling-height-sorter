# seedling-height-sorter
This is a simple web app made to make planting a large group of young plants easier. It sorts the plants by height, and provides you with the option to print out the list so you can take it with you while gardening. The app was made using JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. 

The live site can be viewed [here](https://superb-druid-b2a311.netlify.app/).

### Features I am currently in the process of adding:

- The plant list being stored as a cookie
- Editing and deletion of individual plants
- All conversions being located in one file
- Plant suggestions automatically populating the height input field
- Improvements to the user interface
